### 1. Introduction

The main goal of this course is to present the basics of `Deep Learning` and some of its _applications_. It is based on several widely known courses that has proven effective such as the [Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) and [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/index.html) website.

We will take interest in various domains of Deep Learning such as _Computer Vision_, _Generative Models_, and _Natural Language Processing_, To put into application what you will learn, various practical sessions will be performed along with a small project on a specific task.

### 4. Setup

Before starting, you may have to create new enviornment for the lab. Kindly, checkout the [documentation](https://github.com/mohammadzainabbas/Deep-Learning-Lab-CS/blob/main/docs/SETUP_ENV.md) for creating an new environment.

#

If you want to follow along with the lab exercises, make sure to clone and `cd` to the relevant lab's directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohammadzainabbas/Deep-Learning-Lab-CS.git
cd Deep-Learning-Lab-CS/src/<lab-of-your-choice>
```

> For e.g: if you want to practice lab # 1, then you should do `cd Deep-Learning-Lab-CS/src/multi-layer-perceptron`.
